We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day. We have 3.44 PB of RAM deployed across our fleet of C* servers - and this traffic is growing daily.

    "Description": "About the job\r\nAs a global leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike protects the people, processes and technologies that drive modern organizations. Since 2011, our mission hasn’t changed — we’re here to stop breaches, and we’ve redefined modern security with the world’s most advanced AI-native platform. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day. We have 3.44 PB of RAM deployed across our fleet of C* servers - and this traffic is growing daily. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We’re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate a culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We’re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.\r\n\r\nAbout The Role\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is looking for a Senior Windows Kernel Sensor Engineer to join our growing Content Research and Integration team within the EndPoint Protection Content group, which focuses on security related endpoint development on the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Endpoint Protection Content group plays a central role in fulfilling CrowdStrike’s mission to Stop Breaches.\r\n\r\nWithin the Content Research and Integration team (CRI), we develop innovative capabilities to detect suspicious or malicious behavior on customer endpoint devices. Our goal is to enable the sensor to autonomously identify and stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build the capabilities to detect and prevent their malicious activity. Our detection strategies are primarily performed directly on the endpoint, but can also execute in the cloud, and may also utilize a hybrid approach combining aspects of both environments. This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.\r\n\r\nAs a Windows Kernel Sensor engineer within the CRI Windows team you will be focused on the research and development of sensor capabilities to provide visibility and detection support for attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement detection logic within the Falcon sensor which includes both user-mode and kernel-mode components that together observe system activity, recognize malicious behavior, provide on-box prevention and remediation capabilities, and send relevant security related telemetry to the Falcon Cloud. You’ll help find creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping to develop cross platform features that leverage telemetry from common OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and network activity. You’ll get exposure to both user-mode and kernel-mode coding practices.\r\n\r\nAs a Senior Engineer, you’ll function as a key resource and subject matter expert for other engineers within the team and across the group. You’ll collaborate with various other teams as you drive your own initiatives and assist with other projects. You’ll be expected to make significant contributions from the initial concept phase through design, implementation, release, and bugtail/support. We're looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build.\r\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\r\n\r\nDesign and build detection logic and systems leveraged across teams within CrowdStrike to detect cyber attackers and stop breaches.\r\nExtend our existing Windows codebase and test suites utilizing C/C++, Python, and other tools as appropriate.\r\nBrainstorm, define, and build collaboratively across multiple teams.\r\nBuild elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems.\r\nObsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies & tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team.\r\nDeliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy.\r\nTroubleshoot issues within the product when necessary, assisting customer support.\r\nLeverage your understanding of engineering best practices, including topics like secure coding, testing paradigms, effective peer code reviews, logging, and resilient architecture patterns, to ensure that our code is clean.\r\nBe an energetic ‘self-starter’ who is empowered to take ownership and be accountable for deliverables, both individually and when leading a team.\r\n\r\nWhat You'll Need\r\n\r\n5+ years of recent experience designing, building, and delivering high-quality software in a shipping product, written in C/C++ for Windows\r\n2+ years of recent experience dealing with Windows internals, security features, and low-level system programming, APIs and design\r\nTeam player – able to lead, mentor, communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a globally distributed team\r\nAbility to work remotely and independently with minimal supervision while still delivering on expected outcomes\r\n\r\nBonus Points\r\n\r\nRecent prior security experience, particularly in exploit and vulnerability analysis.\r\nRecent prior experience writing Windows kernel-mode drivers in a shipping product.\r\nRecent prior development or testing experience with Python.\r\n\r\nBenefits Of Working At CrowdStrike\r\n\r\nRemote-friendly and flexible work culture\r\nMarket leader in compensation and equity awards\r\nComprehensive physical and mental wellness programs\r\nCompetitive vacation and holidays for recharge\r\nPaid parental and adoption leaves\r\nProfessional development opportunities for all employees regardless of level or role\r\nEmployee Resource Groups, geographic neighbourhood groups and volunteer opportunities to build connections\r\nVibrant office culture with world class amenities\r\nGreat Place to Work Certified™ across the globe \r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to fostering a culture of belonging where everyone is valued for who they are and empowered to succeed. We support veterans and individuals with disabilities through our affirmative action program.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment. The Company does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, creed, ethnicity, religion, sex (including pregnancy or pregnancy-related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or family status, veteran status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical disability (including HIV and AIDS), mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, membership or activity in a local human rights commission, status with regard to public assistance, or any other characteristic protected by law. We base all employment decisions--including recruitment, selection, training, compensation, benefits, discipline, promotions, transfers, lay-offs, return from lay-off, terminations and social/recreational programs--on valid job requirements.\r\n\r\nIf you need assistance accessing or reviewing the information on this website or need help submitting an application for employment or requesting an accommodation, please contact us at recruiting@crowdstrike.com for further assistance.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike Canada ULC is committed to equal pay for equal work in its compensation practices.

Does it excite you to find patterns and build generic, composable software solutions to solve complex problems? Are you looking for inventing newer and simpler ways of building solutions? If so, we are looking for you to fill a challenging position.\r\n\r\nWe are the one stop shop for all shopping experience building product displays. Through our highly available Tier-1 services we provide the building blocks for Product displays that enable our experience owners to perform at scale. We power experiences like Search, Personalization, Cart and Checkout across all platforms including Amazon.com, and mobile. As an SDE II on our team, you will design and build software that is highly available, performant, scalable, and extensible.

You write code that an SDE unfamiliar with the system can understand. You are proficient in a broad range of design approaches and know when it is appropriate to make trade-offs. Your solutions are pragmatic. You do things with the proper level of complexity the first time (or at least minimize incidental complexity). You consider the legacy of the code you produce, limiting the use of short-term workarounds. You create flexible software without over-engineering. You re-use where possible, while being judicious about introducing dependencies. You are efficient with resource usage (e.g., designing to avoid impacting the system under test.)\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting opportunity for a seasoned engineer. In this position, you will play a leading role in the architecture, design, implementation and deployment of large-scale and complex applications.

    "JobOfferTitle": "Software Engineer III - Linux Content Development (Remote, CAN)",
    "CompanyName": "CrowdStrike",
    "ContactHiringSection": "",
    "Description": "About the job\r\nAs a global leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike protects the people, processes and technologies that drive modern organizations. Since 2011, our mission hasn’t changed — we’re here to stop breaches, and we’ve redefined modern security with the world’s most advanced AI-native platform. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day. We have 3.44 PB of RAM deployed across our fleet of C* servers - and this traffic is growing daily. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We’re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate a culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We’re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.\r\n\r\nAbout The Team\r\n\r\nThe Content Development (CD) is a team which resides within the Endpoint Protection area of CrowdStrike – an area which is responsible for enabling detections and preventions of malicious behaviours on the Falcon Platform. The CD team is focused on strategic, forward leaning research into new Falcon Sensor capabilities to identify various tactics and techniques used by adversaries. We accomplish this by focusing on OS security/internals for all major supported platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and exposing the right data to the sensor in a supportable and performant manner. Most of our projects involve months of research, planning, coordination, and implementation to be successful. We currently support several key Falcon Sensor technologies that are leveraged by detection and response teams to increase telemetry, detections, and preventions on the platform\r\n\r\nAbout The Role\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.\r\n\r\nThe cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments. This is a Linux Engineer role in the engineering team that delivers code for the Linux sensor (lightweight agent). SDE’s in the team own design and development of core features on the platform. Features will cross-cut most core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Mac and Linux. The team operates under the Agile development principles and ships frequently.\r\n\r\nIn this role you will research techniques for detecting malicious activity. Once researched you will develop them into production level solutions for deployment. This role requires a combination of deep understanding of Linux kernel and user space and a large amount of solution creativity. The role is a split of research and implementation working alongside a small group of engineers.\r\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\r\n\r\nResearch, design and develop software for deployment\r\nOwn features from design to delivery\r\nCollaborate with multi-functional team spread across geographies\r\nTroubleshoot issues with the product as reported from customers responsively\r\nOther projects as assigned\r\n\r\nWhat You’ll Need\r\n\r\nDeep knowledge of Linux Internals\r\nFamiliarity and ideally experience with the Linux kernel programming and/or eBPF technology\r\nCan develop high-quality code in one and ideally more of the following languages: C/C++ with the following characteristics:\r\nhigh concurrency requirements needing strong use of multi-threading\r\nhigh reliability requirements\r\ndetailed requirements on low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, conformance to standards)\r\nAbility to collaborate and deliver enterprise software working with various teams CI, testing, release management and quality assurance teams\r\nExperience in reverse engineering, vulnerability research, security application software development is a plus\r\nAble to communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team\r\nBenefits Of Working At CrowdStrike\r\n\r\nRemote-friendly and flexible work culture\r\nMarket leader in compensation and equity awards\r\nComprehensive physical and mental wellness programs\r\nCompetitive vacation and holidays for recharge\r\nPaid parental and adoption leaves\r\nProfessional development opportunities for all employees regardless of level or role\r\nEmployee Resource Groups, geographic neighbourhood groups and volunteer opportunities to build connections\r\nVibrant office culture with world class amenities\r\nGreat Place to Work Certified™ across the globe \r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to fostering a culture of belonging where everyone is valued for who they are and empowered to succeed. We support veterans and individuals with disabilities through our affirmative action program.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment.

Does it excite you to find patterns and build generic, composable software solutions to solve complex problems? Are you looking for inventing newer and simpler ways of building solutions? If so, we are looking for you to fill a challenging position.\r\n\r\nWe are the one stop shop for all shopping experience building product displays. Through our highly available Tier-1 services we provide the building blocks for Product displays that enable our experience owners to perform at scale. We power experiences like Search, Personalization, Cart and Checkout across all platforms including Amazon.com, and mobile. As an SDE II on our team, you will design and build software that is highly available, performant, scalable, and extensible. You will own the software development process end to end and be responsible for design, implementation, testing and operations.\r\n\r\nThis position requires that you are a significant and autonomous contributor. Your work is consistently high quality. You solve complex problems, applying appropriate technologies and best practices. Your focus is on designing, developing and effectively applying automated solutions that test major portions of software (e.g., significant component, set of features, mid-size application, service, etc.). You prevent and find defects early. You apply software testing techniques, such as boundary value testing, etc. You build complete test and/or measurement solutions (e.g., performance, load, scalability, usability, etc.) You use data from testing, deployment, and production to measure quality and provide actionable improvement to the product. You write code that an SDE unfamiliar with the system can understand. You are proficient in a broad range of design approaches and know when it is appropriate to make trade-offs. Your solutions are pragmatic. You do things with the proper level of complexity the first time (or at least minimize incidental complexity). You consider the legacy of the code you produce, limiting the use of short-term workarounds. You create flexible software without over-engineering. You re-use where possible, while being judicious about introducing dependencies. You are efficient with resource usage (e.g., designing to avoid impacting the system under test.)\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting opportunity for a seasoned engineer. In this position, you will play a leading role in the architecture, design, implementation and deployment of large-scale and complex applications. You will push your design and architecture limits by inventing and simplifying complex problems. You have strong verbal and written communication skills, are self-driven, and can deliver high quality results in a fast-paced environment.

    "Description": "About the job\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nAmazon.com stores and sells millions of unique items through its Fulfillment Centers (FCs), Sort Center (SC) and Delivery Station (DS) network globally. This is a hugely complex logistics network with hundreds of thousands of transportation assets of different types (trailers, box trucks, airplanes, etc.), in different operational states (empty, loading, etc.), on the move or stationary and in different locations around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Relay Yard Automation (RYA) organization provides tier-1 products used by Amazon associates during line haul vehicle arrival,\r\n\r\nloading, and departure processes at over 6000 Amazon Fulfillment, Sort Centers, and Delivery Stations in our middle-mile logistics network in North America, Europe, and Japan retail regions. RYA products provide automation in yard processes that create a safer and faster environment for both Amazon associates working in the field and drivers visiting our facilities. In the past year, RYA software facilitated the arrival and departure of 50M vehicles and the loading / unloading of 30M trailers globally. Execution signals produced by RYA software play a critical role in upstream partner systems that measure linehaul carrier performance (via yard on-time driver arrival signals) and systems that detect and mitigate logistics disruptions that jeopardize Amazon meeting customer delivery promises (via on-time trailer loading and yard departure signals). To keep associates safe,\r\n\r\nYA software models and enforces safe standard operating procedures for associates working in hazardous trailer yards.\r\n\r\nRelay Yard Automation is an org of 30 individuals, which owns multiple products and supporting services. Associates-facing products include: (1) the Sesame app and GEM are software tools used by gate associates to manually check-\r\n\r\nin and check-out of drivers arriving and departing from Amazon facilities, (2) Relay Gate enables automation and remote (call-center) management of gate operations, (3) the Valet app used by yard “hostler” drivers to move trailers within yards to support loading/unloading of packages and to perform yard audits, and (4) Yard Inventory Manager (YIM) and the Yard Dashboard which provides real-time visibility to yard operators where trailers are located in a yard as well as provide data-feeds for trailer pool re-balancing systems to ensure Amazon trailers are sufficiently spread across the logistics network.\r\n\r\nAs a Software Development Engineer (SDE) on the Relay Yard Automation team, you will design, develop, and deliver high-quality, scalable software solutions from concept through launch. Leveraging your strong technical skills and engineering expertise, you will write robust code, perform code reviews, and maintain high standards of software excellence to continually raise the bar for our customers.\r\n\r\nYou will collaborate closely with product managers, TPMs, and cross-functional technical teams to ensure seamless integration of systems and timely delivery of features. You'll proactively identify and address technical risks, remove blockers, and track engineering milestones to meet project timelines. Utilizing a data-driven and customer-centric approach, you'll innovate solutions aligned with business objectives, actively championing improvements in our products and operational excellence across the organization.\r\n\r\nBasic Qualifications\r\n\r\n 3+ years of non-internship professional software development experience\r\n 2+ years of non-internship design or architecture (design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and existing systems experience\r\n Experience programming with at least one software programming language\r\n\r\nPreferred Qualifications\r\n\r\n 3+ years of full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations experience\r\n Bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent\r\n\r\nAmazon is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of protected veteran status, disability, or other legally protected status.\r\n\r\nOur inclusive culture empowers Amazonians to deliver the best results for our customers.

    "Description": "About the job\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nAmazon.com stores and sells millions of unique items through its Fulfillment Centers (FCs), Sort Center (SC) and Delivery Station (DS) network globally. This is a hugely complex logistics network with hundreds of thousands of transportation assets of different types (trailers, box trucks, airplanes, etc.), in different operational states (empty, loading, etc.), on the move or stationary and in different locations around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Relay Yard Automation (RYA) organization provides tier-1 products used by Amazon associates during line haul vehicle arrival,\r\n\r\nloading, and departure processes at over 6000 Amazon Fulfillment, Sort Centers, and Delivery Stations in our middle-mile logistics network in North America, Europe, and Japan retail regions. RYA products provide automation in yard processes that create a safer and faster environment for both Amazon associates working in the field and drivers visiting our facilities. In the past year, RYA software facilitated the arrival and departure of 50M vehicles and the loading / unloading of 30M trailers globally. Execution signals produced by RYA software play a critical role in upstream partner systems that measure linehaul carrier performance (via yard on-time driver arrival signals) and systems that detect and mitigate logistics disruptions that jeopardize Amazon meeting customer delivery promises (via on-time trailer loading and yard departure signals). To keep associates safe,\r\n\r\nYA software models and enforces safe standard operating procedures for associates working in hazardous trailer yards.\r\n\r\nRelay Yard Automation is an org of 30 individuals, which owns multiple products and supporting services. Associates-facing products include: (1) the Sesame app and GEM are software tools used by gate associates to manually check-\r\n\r\nin and check-out of drivers arriving and departing from Amazon facilities, (2) Relay Gate enables automation and remote (call-center) management of gate operations, (3) the Valet app used by yard “hostler” drivers to move trailers within yards to support loading/unloading of packages and to perform yard audits, and (4) Yard Inventory Manager (YIM) and the Yard Dashboard which provides real-time visibility to yard operators where trailers are located in a yard as well as provide data-feeds for trailer pool re-balancing systems to ensure Amazon trailers are sufficiently spread across the logistics network.\r\n\r\nAs a Software Development Engineer (SDE) on the Relay Yard Automation team, you will design, develop, and deliver high-quality, scalable software solutions from concept through launch. Leveraging your strong technical skills and engineering expertise, you will write robust code, perform code reviews, and maintain high standards of software excellence to continually raise the bar for our customers.\r\n\r\nYou will collaborate closely with product managers, TPMs, and cross-functional technical teams to ensure seamless integration of systems and timely delivery of features. You'll proactively identify and address technical risks, remove blockers, and track engineering milestones to meet project timelines. Utilizing a data-driven and customer-centric approach, you'll innovate solutions aligned with business objectives, actively championing improvements in our products and operational excellence across the organization.\r\n\r\nA day in the life\r\n\r\nAmazon offers a full range of benefits that support you and eligible family members, including domestic partners and their children.
